## SIT215 â€“ Artificial and Computational Intelligence Project
### Investigating Reinforcement Learning


### Agents and Environments



Three [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments were used:

1. [Taxi-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/)
1. [Cartpole-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)
1. [FrozenLake-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)

Training and evaluation runs for combinations of agent and environemnt
are marshalled through a
https://github.com/ayyaron777/ayyaron777.git

The following runs are available:

- Taxi, Random Agent
- Taxi, QLearner Agent
- Cartpole, Random Agent
- Cartpole, QLearner Agent
- Taxi, TDLearner Agent
- Frozen Lake, Random Agent
- Frozen Lake, QLearner Agent
- Frozen Lake, TDLearner Agent

## Setup

This project was built on windows in Python 3.
